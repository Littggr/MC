Ideas - 
	incoming items for storage block creation go into seperate buffers
	when 10 items are in the buffer, create a storage block with 9 of them and send 1 through to storage with the completed block
	use computercraft to monitor the item buffers and control turtles
	use wireless crafty turtles to make the storage blocks
